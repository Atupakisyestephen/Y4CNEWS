- On reaching NEMC the two team twelve members,Atupakisye and Naif they confroted the guard at the gate hoping to 
get a bit of assistance to whom specifically they were supposed to deliver their letter to.

-As expected the guard asked these two youngsters of their student's identification cards.They ended up being permitted
to enter the institution as soon as they gave him their IDs, soon enough the two individuals accomplished their task
by delivering the letter.

-When they approached the gate with the intent of leaving, one guard kept protesting of Naif's nationality
thanks to the boy's colleague nothing went wrong.
