The whole journey started at around at 11am, having Winock as the group leader. Team Twelve began from COICT, 
they took a mbezi route bus hoping to reach EWURA, located at PSSSF tower near Magufuli hostels to conduct their research.
 After a few minutes they reached KIVULINI bus stand and decided to continue their journey on foot, after  a five minutesâ€™ walk they reached PSSSF. 
At the gate the guard kindly directed these young students that whatever they were looking for was in the 4th floor, finally they did they research
but on the way back a heavy rain powered on them trully it's a pity.
